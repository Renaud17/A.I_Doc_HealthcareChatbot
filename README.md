as well as general questions. By asking the questions in series it helps 
patients by guiding what exactly he/she is gotten into. This in term helps 
Doctor to get information about the patients before physical interaction 
if needed.
Why a sudden need of this 
Chatbot?
Chatbots are services that people 
interact with through a messenger. 
Instead of having a conversation with 
another person, the user talks with a bot 
that's either powered by basic rules or 
machine learning. Every chatbot serves 
a specific purpose — health bots are 
designed to help with health-related 
issues
Future Scope of this Project
• Design to help with health-related 
issues.
• More precise diagnoses and 
recommend treatment based on 
patients’ symptoms. 
• More interactive interface.
